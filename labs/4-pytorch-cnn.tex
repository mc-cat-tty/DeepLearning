\subsection{VGG-16}
The number at the end of the network's name usually indicates the number of layers.

We will use \texttt{torch.Conv2D} and \texttt{torch.Linear} objects. Inside the \texttt{\_\_init\_\_} method of a \texttt{nn.Module} we define all learnable objects.
Everything else can be put inside, for instance, the forward function.

We define a custom layer to avoid code repetition (convolution - activation - pooling) in the NN. Sequential block to sequentialize the custom layers.
